  color: 'Vaginal discharge can appear in a range of colors, including clear, white, yellow, green, brown, gray, pink, or red. Clear or white is often seen during different phases of the ' +
    'menstrual cycle. Yellow or green may also occur and can vary in shade. Brown and red often relate to menstrual blood, while pink might appear at the beginning or end of a period. Gray ' +
    'is less common but still possible. Understanding the variety of colors can help you notice changes and seek more information if needed.',
  odor: 'Vaginal discharge can have different types of odor, ranging from no noticeable smell to mild, musky, or slightly sweet scents, which are typically normal. Sometimes, discharge may ' +
    'have a stronger or more distinct odor, such as metallic, due to menstrual blood, or a slightly sour smell influenced by the vaginal pH. Odor can vary naturally throughout the menstrual ' +
    'cycle, but itâ€™s helpful to be aware of your baseline scent to notice any changes over time.',
  consistency: 'Vaginal discharge can vary in texture and consistency, ranging from thin and watery to thick and creamy. It may also be stretchy and egg white-like, especially around ' +
    'ovulation. Some discharge can appear clumpy or sticky, while at other times it may be smooth and lotion-like. These variations are often normal and can change throughout the menstrual ' +
    'cycle or due to other natural factors.',
  symptom: 'Other symptoms that can accompany vaginal discharge include itching, burning, redness, swelling, irritation, or soreness around the vulva or vagina. Some individuals may experience ' +
    'pelvic or lower abdominal cramps, pain during urination or intercourse, or general discomfort. These symptoms can vary in intensity and may come and go, depending on the underlying cause ' +
     'or where you are in your cycle. Keeping track of any additional symptoms along with changes in discharge can help you better understand your body and when to seek medical advice.'
